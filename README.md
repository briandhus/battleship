# Battleship!
Classic game of Battleship

If you are concerned about ES6 compatability with your browser, npm install and then run build. The script is in the package.json under build.

## To begin playing:

1.) Choose from the selector whether to place your ship vertically or horizontally before you place each ship. First ship to place is the carrier. 

2.) Once you click on a valid square in zone 1 (valid is the number of spots in length ** of the current ship ** from the right edge or the number of spots in length from the bottom edge).

3.) Once the last ship is placed (the destroyer), you can click on Zone 2 to atack the computer's fleet of ships.

Carrier: 5 squares

Battleship: 4 squares

Cruiser: 3 squares

Submarine: 3 squares

### Good luck and have fun!
