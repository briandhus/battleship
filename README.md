# Battleship!
Classic game of Battleship

If you are concerned about ES6 compatability with your browser, npm install and then run build. The script is in the package.json under build.

To begin playing, you can either:

1.) Start clicking on the Computer Ship Zone - Zone 2, and see what targets you can hit

- or -

2.) Click the start button and start placing your own ships (Sorry, but this functionality isn't quite finised yet).

Have fun!
